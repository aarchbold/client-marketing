                  <strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND AGREEMENT</strong>
                  <p>By clicking “I Accept” below, I agree, understand and confirm that:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
                    <li>The purpose of the Shyft app (“Shyft”) is to provide associates a more convenient way to swap shifts with other associates or pick up additional shifts posted by an SLT member.</li>
                    <li>Shyft is not intended to be used when I need to call off work.  If I need to call off work, I must follow the Company’s standard procedures for doing so.</li>
                    <li>Use of the Shyft app is completely voluntary and is not required by my employer. I may continue to use other means or processes of swapping shifts and Shyft is not intended to replace those other available means or processes.  </li>
                    <li>Accepting shift swaps or additional shifts posted by an SLT member is voluntary and I am not required to accept shifts that were not included on the original published schedule.</li>
                    <li>If I am ever asked to or feel I am required to use Shyft, I will report it immediately by calling the Ethics Hotline at 1.888.884.7218 or www.lb.ethicspoint.com.</li>
                    <li> At any time, I may discontinue my use of Shyft by simply deleting the app, and my access to Shyft may be revoked at any time.</li>
                    <li>A shift swap conducted via Shyft is not complete until the swap has been approved by an SLT member.</li>
                    <li>I agree and understand that all Company policies and procedures apply to my use of Shyft, including but not limited to the Code of Conduct.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Additional Acknowledgements for Store Administrators Only:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
                    <li>It is my responsibility to approve or deny associate driven shift change requests and/or post open shifts consistent with Company policy. I may use a Company-provided device to do so.</li>
                    <li>I must ensure that any and all schedule changes accepted in Shyft are also captured in ACES and, if required in my location, that a Schedule Change Form is completed.When I post an open shift or approve or deny shift change requests via Shyft, such activities must be done when I am in the store and clocked in.  I am not permitted to perform any work on Shyft (including signing up to become an Administrator) when I am not clocked in. If I am ever asked to or feel I am required to do so, I will report it immediately by calling the Ethics Hotline at 1.888.884.7218 or www.lb.ethicspoint.com. </li>
                    <li>I may not require an associate to download or use Shyft.  Associates’ use of Shyft is completely voluntary.</li>
                    <li>Communications sent via Shyft must relate only to the posting of shifts or the approval or denial of shift swaps on the Shyft app. I may not send other work-related communications via Shyft to associates, including to other Administrators.</li>
                    <li>When an associate calls off work, the Company’s standard procedures still apply and it is my role as a store leader to find coverage for an associate who has called off work.   If an associate cannot work a scheduled shift for any reason, I may not ask the associate to find replacement coverage.</li>
