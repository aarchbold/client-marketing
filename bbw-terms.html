                  <strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND AGREEMENT</strong>
                  <p>By clicking “I Accept” below, I agree, understand and confirm that:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
                    <li>The purpose of the Shyft app (“Shyft”) is to provide associates a more convenient way to swap shifts with other associates (Stores Only) or pick up shifts posted by an Administrator.  Shyft is not intended to be used when I need to call off work.  If I need to call off work, I must follow the Company’s standard procedures for doing so.Use of the Shyft app is completely voluntary and is not required by my employer.  I may continue to use other means or processes of swapping shifts and Shyft is not intended to replace those other means or processes.  Accepting shift swaps or additional shifts posted by an administrator is voluntary and I am not required to accept shifts that were not included on the original posted schedule.If I am ever asked to or feel I am required to use Shyft, I will report it immediately by calling the Ethics Hotline at 1.888.884.7218 or www.lb.ethicspoint.com. At any time, I may discontinue my use of Shyft by simply deleting the app, and my access to Shyft may be revoked at any time.A shift swap conducted via Shyft (Stores Only) is not complete until the swap has been approved by an Administrator.  I agree and understand that all Company policies and procedures apply to my use of Shyft, including but not limited to the Code of Conduct.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Additional Acknowledgements for Store Administrators Only:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
                    <li>It is my responsibility to approve or deny associate driven shift change requests and/or post open shifts.  I may use a Company-provided device to do so.I must ensure that any and all schedule changes accepted in Shyft are also captured in ACES and, if required in my location, that a Schedule Change Form is completed.When I post an open shift or approve or deny shift change requests via Shyft, such activities must be done when I am in the store and clocked in.  I am not permitted to perform any work on Shyft (including signing up to become an Administrator) when I am not clocked in. If I am ever asked to or feel I am required to do so, I will report it immediately by calling the Ethics Hotline at 1.888.884.7218 or www.lb.ethicspoint.com. I may not require an associate to download or use Shyft.  Associates’ use of Shyft is completely voluntary.Communications sent via Shyft must relate only to scheduling of shifts at the store.  I may not send other work-related communications via Shyft to associates, including other Administrators.When an associate calls off work, the Company’s standard procedures still apply and it is my role as a store leader to find coverage for an associate who has called off work.   If an associate cannot work a scheduled shift for any reason, I may not ask the associate to find replacement coverage.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Additional Acknowledgements for Distribution Center Administrators Only:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
                    <li>When I post an open shift via Shyft, it must be done when I am in the distribution center (“DC”) and clocked in.  I may use a Company-provided device to do so.  I am not permitted to post open shifts or perform any work on Shyft (including signing up to become an Administrator)  when I am not in the DC and clocked in. If I am ever asked to or feel I am required to do so, I will report it immediately by calling the Ethics Hotline at 1.888.884.7218 or www.lb.ethicspoint.com.
