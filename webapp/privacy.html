                <div class="legal-container">
                    <strong>Effective: May 1, 2017</strong><br />
                  <strong>Shyft Privacy Policy</strong>
                  <p>This privacy policy is here to help you understand what information we collect at Shyft, how we use it, and what choices you have. When we talk about Shyft in this policy, we are talking about Shyft Technologies, Inc. the company, Shyft, the downloadable application, and the Shyft website at www.myshyft.com. The Shyft dashboard application is available for use via a web browser or applications specific to your desktop or mobile device.</p>

                  <p>This policy describes how Shyft treats your information, not how other organizations treat your information. If you are using Shyft in a workplace or on a device or account issued to you by your employer or another organization, that company or organization likely has its own policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, and retention of communications and content which may apply to your use of Shyft. Content that would otherwise be considered private to you or to a limited group of people may, in some cases, be accessible by your administrator. Please check with your employer or administrator about the policies it has in place regarding your communications and related content on Shyft.</p>

                  <p>In this policy we talk about various roles within a Shyft team and the privileges that come with each. It's helpful to understand these roles and the relationships between them. Here's the breakdown: primary owner > network admin > location admin > team member. Primary owners have the most control over their company's settings on Shyft, followed by network admins and then location admins. The person who establishes the Shyft network is considered the primary owner with the most control over the account. Networks can have more than one admin, but only one can be the primary owner. Primary ownership can be transferred to another user after the team is created. All network and location admins are also team members.</p>

                  <strong>Information we collect and receive</strong>
                  <p>We collect different kinds of information. Some of it is personally identifiable and some is non-identifying or aggregated. Here are the types of information we collect or receive:</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>Network information. When you create a network on Shyft, we collect your phone number, your email address (as the primary owner), your company name, your user name that appears in your Shyft network, and password. </li>
                    <li>Account and profile information. The only information we require to create your Shyft account is a phone number, or email address and password. Optional information you can enter into your profile includes information such as your first and last name, and a profile image. Any information you add to your profile is visible to other people in your network.</li>
                    <li>Log data. When you use Shyft, our servers automatically record information including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you're using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you visited before coming to Shyft, your browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, information about your browser configuration and plug-ins, language preferences, and cookie data.</li>
                    <li>Device information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you're using Shyft on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're using and its settings.</li>
                    <li>Geo-location information. Precise GPS from mobile devices is collected only with your permission. WiFi and IP addresses received from your browser or device may be used to determine approximate location.</li>
                    <li>Shyft usage information. This is information about which network, location, groups, people, features, content, and links you interact with within Shyft.</li>
                    <li>Communication content that you send and receive within Shyft. This includes:
                      <ol>
                        <li>The message content itself. This content can include messages, pictures, files and video among other types of files.</li>
                        <li>When messages or files were sent and by whom, when or if they were seen by you, and where you received them (in a newsfeed, private chat group, or direct message, for example).</li>
                      </ol></li>
                    <li>Information from partners or other 3rd parties. Shyft may receive information from partners or others that we could use to make our own information better or more useful. This might be aggregate level information about which IP addresses go with which zip codes or it might be more specific information about how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <strong>Our Cookie Policy</strong>

                  <p>Shyft uses cookies, or similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons, to record log data. We use both session-based and persistent cookies.</p>

                  <p>Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer and from your computer to us, each time you visit our website. They are unique to your Shyft account or your browser. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.</p>

                  <p>Some cookies are associated with your Shyft account and personal information in order to remember that you are logged in and which network you are logged into. Other cookies are not tied to your Shyft account but are unique and allow us to do site analytics and customization, among other things. If you access Shyft through your browser, you can manage your cookie settings there but if you disable all cookies you may not be able to use Shyft.</p>

                  <p>Shyft sets and accesses our own cookies on our company-owned domains. In addition, we use 3rd parties like Google Analytics for website analytics. Google Analytics provides their own opt-out. We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.</p>

                  <strong>How we use your information</strong>

                  <p>We use your information for the following:</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>Providing the Shyft service. We use information you provide to authenticate you and deliver message content to you and from you.</li>
                    <li>Understanding and improving our products. To make the product better we have to understand how users are using it. We have a fair bit of data about usage and we intend to use it many different ways to improve our products, including research. This policy is not intended to place any limits on what we do with usage data that is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer tied to a Shyft user.</li>
                    <li>Investigating and preventing bad stuff from happening. We work hard to keep Shyft secure and to prevent abuse and fraud.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communicating with you:</strong>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Solving your problems and responding to your requests. If you contact us with a problem or question, we will use your information to respond to that request and address your problems or concerns.</li>
                      <li>In-product communications. We may use the information you provide to contact you through Shyft using Shyft chat or other in-product messaging tools.</li>
                      <li>Email and Text messages. We may send you service and administrative emails or text messages, such as when we notice that you are nearing a message limit. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our services, or our service offerings. These messages are considered part of the service and you may not opt-out of them. In addition, we sometimes send emails or text messages to Shyft users about new product features or other news about Shyft. You can opt-out of these at any time.</li>
                    </ol></li>
                  </ol>

                  <strong>Your choices</strong>
                  <p>When you use Shyft, you have control over a number of things with respect to your own privacy and choices about how your content is visible to others or not. If you are a Shyft network or location admin, you have additional choices that impact your networks privacy. Some users will not have access to all of the same choices that their network or location admins do. That is because Shyft is set up to be company oriented, and provides network admins with the maximum ability to control their company.</p>

                  <strong>Message Retention Settings</strong>

                  <p>The default message retention settings retain all channel, private group, and direct messages of all team members for as long as the network exists. If a message is edited, only the last edited version of the message is retained. If a message is deleted, it will no longer be visible in your network, however it will remain archived for the legal limit of duration. Depending on your network settings, you may have the ability to delete some or all of your messages. To deactivate your account please contact support@myshyft.com. Deactivating your account, however, will not remove messages you posted before you initiated deactivation as those messages will still be valuable to your network.</p>

                  <strong>Sharing and Disclosure</strong>

                  <p>There are times when communications and related content and other user information may be shared by Shyft. This section discusses only how Shyft may share user information. Organizations that use Shyft may have their own policies for sharing and disclosure of information they can access through Shyft. Shyft may share information:</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>With consent, to comply with legal process, or to protect Shyft and our users. When we have your consent or if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Shyft; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. If we receive a legal or law enforcement request for information we will do our best to notify the subject of the request if we are able.</li>
                    <li>With third parties and agents. We may employ third party companies or individuals to process personal information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share data with a security consultant to help us get better at preventing unauthorized access or with an email vendor to send messages on our behalf. We may also share data with hosting providers, payment processors, marketing vendors, and other consultants who work on our behalf and under contractual promises of confidentiality.</li>
                    <li><strong>About you with your organization or network administrator(s).</strong>
                    <ol>
                      <li>We may share your phone number or email address with your organization. If the phone number or email address under which you've registered your account belongs to or is controlled by an organization we may disclose that phone number or email address and associated team names to that organization in order to help it understand who associated with that organization uses Shyft, and to assist the organization with its enterprise accounts. Please do not use a work phone number or email address for our services unless you are authorized to do so, and are therefore comfortable with this kind of sharing.</li>
                      <li>In addition, there may be times when you contact Shyft to help resolve an issue specific to a network you are a member of. In order to help resolve the issue, we may need to share your concern with your administrator. When possible, we will try to mask or remove any identifying information before sharing these communications.</li>
                    </ol></li>
                    <li>In the event of a merger or sale. If we engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                    <li>That is aggregated and non-identifiable. We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with our partners or others for business or research purposes. For example, we may tell a prospective Shyft customer the average number of messages sent within a Shyft network in a day or may partner with a research firm or academics to explore interesting questions about workplace communications. Again, this policy is not intended to prohibit the disclosure and use of aggregated or de-identified data.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <strong>Security</strong>
                  <p>Shyft takes reasonable steps to protect information you provide to us as part of your use of the Shyft service from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information (such as sign-in credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no electronic or email transmission or digital storage mechanism is ever fully secure or error free.</p>

                  <strong>Children's information</strong>

                  <p>Shyft is not directed to children under 13. If you learn that a minor child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us.</p>

                  <strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong>

                  <p>We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we'll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Shyft after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are material, we may provide more prominent notice or seek your consent to the new policy.</p>

                  <strong>Contacting Shyft</strong>

                  <p>Please also feel free to contact us if you have any questions about Shyft's Privacy Policy or practices. You may contact us at support@myshyft.com or at our mailing address below:</p>
